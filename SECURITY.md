# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in this AWS Terraform Terragrunt project.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. No Hardcoded Sensitive Information
- ✅ All AWS profile names have been replaced with placeholder values
- ✅ All S3 bucket names have been replaced with placeholder values
- ✅ No access keys, secret keys, or passwords in code
- ✅ All sensitive configuration is externalized to variables
- ✅ Example files use placeholder values only

### 2. Credential Management
- ✅ AWS credentials stored in AWS profiles (not in code)
- ✅ Separate credentials for development and production environments
- ✅ No credentials committed to version control
- ✅ IAM roles used for resource access instead of hardcoded credentials

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- ✅ S3 buckets with public access blocking enabled
- ✅ Private ACL for all S3 buckets
- ✅ Remote state stored with encryption
- ✅ Environment isolation with separate state files
- ✅ Proper resource tagging for security and compliance

### 4. State Management Security
- ✅ Remote state stored in S3 with encryption
- ✅ Separate state files for different environments
- ✅ State files not committed to version control
- ✅ Proper access controls on state buckets

### 5. Network Security
- ✅ S3 buckets configured for private access only
- ✅ Public access blocking enabled
- ✅ Proper bucket policies and access controls

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Never commit sensitive information**:
   - AWS access keys and secret keys
   - Passwords and tokens
   - Private keys and certificates
   - Database credentials
   - S3 bucket names with sensitive data

2. **Use secure credential management**:
   - Store credentials in AWS profiles
   - Use AWS IAM roles when possible
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Use AWS SSO for centralized access

3. **Follow the principle of least privilege**:
   - Grant minimal required permissions
   - Use IAM policies to restrict access
   - Regular permission reviews
   - Use resource-based policies

4. **Monitor and audit**:
   - Enable CloudTrail logging
   - Monitor S3 access patterns
   - Regular security assessments
   - Use AWS Config for compliance

### For Administrators

1. **Infrastructure security**:
   - Enable S3 bucket versioning
   - Configure bucket encryption
   - Set up proper bucket policies
   - Implement access logging

2. **Access control**:
   - Use AWS Organizations for multi-account management
   - Implement proper IAM policies
   - Use AWS SSO for centralized access
   - Regular access reviews

3. **Monitoring and alerting**:
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for S3 access
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Implement proper logging
   - Regular security assessments

## Configuration Security

### Required Configuration

Before using this project, you must configure:

1. **AWS Resources**:
   - S3 bucket for Terraform state storage
   - IAM roles and policies for Terraform execution
   - AWS profiles for different environments

2. **Jenkins Configuration**:
   - AWS credentials in Jenkins credentials store
   - Proper pipeline configuration
   - Git repository access

3. **Terraform Variables**:
   - Create `terraform.tfvars` files from examples
   - Replace all placeholder values with actual resource names
   - Never commit `terraform.tfvars` to version control

### Security Checklist

Before deployment, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in any files
- [ ] All sensitive values are in variables
- [ ] `terraform.tfvars` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] AWS profiles are properly configured
- [ ] S3 buckets have encryption enabled
- [ ] Public access blocking is enabled
- [ ] IAM roles follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] CloudTrail logging is enabled
- [ ] Regular backup procedures are in place

## Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Rotate all affected credentials
   - Review access logs for unauthorized activity
   - Disable compromised access keys
   - Update AWS profiles

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review CloudTrail logs
   - Check for unauthorized S3 access
   - Audit IAM policies and roles
   - Review bucket policies

3. **Recovery**:
   - Restore from backups if necessary
   - Update all affected systems
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Document lessons learned

### If S3 Bucket is Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Block public access immediately
   - Review bucket policies
   - Check for unauthorized objects
   - Enable versioning if not already enabled

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review S3 access logs
   - Check CloudTrail for access patterns
   - Audit bucket permissions
   - Review IAM policies

3. **Recovery**:
   - Remove unauthorized objects
   - Update bucket policies
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Document incident response
